ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @Saksiu

I love gaming and coding, so eventually that came around to making games!

I code mainly in Java for now, altough I have some experience in coding in other popular programming languages, like C++/C#.
Also beginning to learn how to use the Unreal Engine 4 and 5 in hopes of creating better games.

One day I hope to make something bigger, or be a part of a team that achieves something noticeable in the gaming industry.
I believe videogames are one of the best interactive forms of entertainment, and I would like to be a part of that world.

Enjoy browsing through my repositories and projects!
