ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @Saksiu

I love gaming and coding, so eventually that came around to making games!

So far I've finished one project that I can call a game, but everyone has to start somewhere.
It's an arcade game about shooting ducks, and You can download it right now (given that You launch it from an IDE, that is).

One day I hope to make something bigger, or be a part of a team that achieves something noticeable in the gaming industry.
I believe videogames are one of the best interactive forms of entertainment, and I would like to be a part of that world.
