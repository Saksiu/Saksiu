ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @Saksiu

Passionate about gaming and coding, and naturally, this led me to game development.
Working with a multi-person team on a 2D game in the Metroidvania genre, similar to classics like "Hollow Knight" as one of the main game programmers as well as design advisor. 

Currently sharpening my C# skills in Unity while creating the aforementioned game, as well as creating more advanced Java 8 applications and learning Python basics while in Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology.

Feel free to dive into my repositories and projects. Enjoy!
