ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @Saksiu

I'm passionate about gaming and coding, and naturally, this led me to game development. 
I used to work with Unreal Engine, but trying out Unity lately. 
Currently, I'm working on a multi-person project in the Metroidvania genre, similar to classics like "Hollow Knight". 

While I have a solid foundation in C++ and Java, I'm now mainly focusing on sharpening my C# skills, which I find immensely versatile and powerful for game development.

I believe video games are one of the finest forms of interactive entertainment, and I'm driven to make my mark in this captivating world. 

Feel free to dive into my repositories and projects. Enjoy!
