ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @Saksiu

I love gaming and coding, so eventually that came around to making games!

I mainly make small programs and games in Unreal Engine 5 and C++ for now.
Just released "Retro Invaders 3D" made in UE5. You can download and play it right now!
So far it's only built and tested for Windows devices, so issued may arise when using a different operating system.

One day I hope to make something bigger, or be a part of a team that achieves something noticeable in the gaming industry.
I believe videogames are one of the best interactive forms of entertainment, and I would like to be a part of that world.

Enjoy browsing through my repositories and projects!
