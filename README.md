ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @Saksiu

I love gaming and coding, so eventually that came around to making games!

So far I've finished one project that I can call a game.

It's an arcade game about shooting ducks, and You can download it right now (given that You compile it first, that is).
Besides game projects, I sometimes add my solutions to common programming tasks.

I code mainly in Java for now, altough I have some experience in coding in other popular programming languages, like C++/C# or Python.

One day I hope to make something bigger, or be a part of a team that achieves something noticeable in the gaming industry.
I believe videogames are one of the best interactive forms of entertainment, and I would like to be a part of that world.
