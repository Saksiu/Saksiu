ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @Saksiu

I'm passionate about gaming and coding, and naturally, this led me to game development.
Created a few projects using Unreal Engine 5, but I am currently learning and actively using Unity.
Currently, I'm working on a multi-person team project in the Metroidvania genre, similar to classics like "Hollow Knight" as one of the main game programmers. 

While I have a solid foundation in C++ and Java, I'm now mainly focusing on sharpening my C# skills, which I find immensely versatile and powerful for game development.

I believe video games are one of the finest forms of interactive entertainment, and I'm driven to make my mark in this captivating world. 

Feel free to dive into my repositories and projects. Enjoy!
