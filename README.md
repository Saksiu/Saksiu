ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @Saksiu

I love gaming and coding, so eventually that came around to making games!

I mainly learn Java and C++, creating Unreal Engine games on the side, which you can access through my itch.io site.  

One day I hope to make something bigger, or be a part of a team that achieves something noticeable in the gaming industry.
I believe videogames are one of the best interactive forms of entertainment, and I would like to be a part of that world.

Enjoy browsing through my repositories and projects!
